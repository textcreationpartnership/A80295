            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Honourable Sir <hi>Joſeph Sheldon,</hi> KNIGHT, Alderman of the Honourable City of LONDON.</head>
            <p>THE very Title of this BOOK is a kind of <hi>Dedication;</hi> and you may juſtly chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge it, by bearing ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent an Office in the <hi>Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery.</hi> Letters and Arms are the two things that govern the whole World; both ſeem to have been mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polized by your generous
<pb facs="tcp:170789:4"/> Family, the former by a Learned Archbiſhop, the latter by your ſelf. And though that <hi>great good Man</hi> has left this World, a grave and learned <hi>Prelate</hi> ſtill ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vives, a collateral Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the name of <hi>Sheldon.</hi> The Book I here humbly lay down at your Feet, was compiled by a <hi>Cheſhire</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, in Commiſſion for that County; his Modeſty will not permit him to put his name to it. Modeſty! that inherent Virtue in all truly noble and generous Souls. His Labour has been great, for ſmaller Tracts require more judgment and
<pb facs="tcp:170789:4"/> induſtry than greater Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes, as tranſlating is more difficult than writing. He has made uſe of ſeveral Authors of the beſt note upon this Subject among the <hi>Ancients,</hi> as <hi>Plutarch, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getius, Xenophon, Homer, Juſtin, Tully, Aelian</hi>'s Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Moderns he has digeſted in ſo compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious a method, that this ſmall Book will be certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moſt extreamly pleaſing; the bulk of other Books of this nature being ſo large, that they require much Time to peruſe, and Money to purchaſe; of which two things, many perſons deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb facs="tcp:170789:5"/> of Experience in <hi>Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> Affairs, can ſpare neither. Uſeful I preſume this ſmall Tract will be, eſpecially in ſuch dangerous Times, wherein no <hi>Poſture</hi> is more convenient than <hi>that of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</hi> Eſpecially conſidering that many Trades and Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations (excepting thoſe of <hi>Handicrafts</hi>) are ſeden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, and in expectation, thoſe intervals of time may be herein ſpent by the Youth of this populous City; by the help of this they may be their own Tutors, and every private Shop ſeem an <hi>Academy for Arms.</hi>

               <p>THe place of Dignity which every Soldier hath, and ought to have, both in Rank and File, ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>
               <p>The noble Soldier, being inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive after Honour, is much deſirous to underſtand his place of Worth and Dignity, which he ever conceives to be as due to him as his life; which was the reaſon that cauſed both the <hi>Grecian</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Generals to be ſo exact and curious in beſtowing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards upon all valiant Soldiers who were deſerving of the ſame, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to every Man's Worth and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, gave him precedence of Place and Command over the others, that they might lead and direct them as occaſion ſhould require, as you may read at large in ſeveral Authors who treat of thoſe Wars;<note place="margin">Xenoph. Cyrop. l. 3. c. 85. and l. 8. 203. Ae. Vegat. l. 3. c. 18.</note> which Cuſtom from that time hath ever ſince been obſerved, and ſtill is practiſed by all Nations.</p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:170789:24"/>
               <p>Therefore it is ſit that the young Soldier ſhould underſtand his place of Dignity, which if he would but eſteem it of that Credit which all former Ages have done, certainly they would take more care to put in practice all ſuch Duties which is thereby requir'd; it is ſtrange to think there ſhould be ſo much ignorance, as there is in our Annual Exerciſes; but finding many very ignorant of the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a <hi>File</hi> and a <hi>Rank,</hi> and what Dignity belongs thereto, induces me to ſhew what is requir'd to the making up of a <hi>File,</hi> and likewiſe of a <hi>Rank,</hi> with the Dignity of each Man as he ſtands, both in <hi>File</hi> and <hi>Rank.</hi>

               <p>A <hi>File</hi> of it ſelf worketh little effect againſt an Enemy, for what can a Man alone in front do? <note place="margin">Xenoph. Cyrop. l. 6. 167.</note>

               <head>CHAP. IX. Reaſons for precedence of Dignity in Ranks and Files.</head>
               <p>BEING that perhaps ſome may ſtumble at this, and ſay that it is ſuperfluous, and not neceſſary in Diſcipline, I will endeavour to give ſome Reaſons for the ſeveral places of Dignity in <hi>Rank</hi> and <hi>File.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is the received opinion of the greateſt Commanders, that Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Proportion gives both Life and Being to orderly Diſcipline; if that be allowed, then conſider that all parts of the Body ought to be anſwerable; for ſeeing that the joyning of <hi>Files</hi> and <hi>Ranks</hi> produce greater Bodies, it is neceſſary that a true proportion ſhould be kept throughout the whole Battel, ſo that the left Wing may be equivalent in all reſpects of worth, skill, and valour, to the Right, the Reer, to the Front, and the Reer half Files, to the Front half Files; and that all parts of the Body be ballanc'd
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170789:27"/> with true proportion, ſo far as the knowledge of the Soldiers, and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Men, will give you leave: Otherwiſe it would be very unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, that all the chief Men ſhould be on the right Flank, and all the worſt on the left (who muſt oppoſe the right Flank of their Enemy); and likewiſe the Front to have in it all the beſt Men, and all the worſt to be in the Reer (who are principally to defend that part); if that at any time the Enemy approach upon the Reer, it would be certainly thought a very indiſcreet thing of that Commander that ſhould ſo order his Battel.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore, the <hi>File-Leader</hi> ought to be the worthieſt, becauſe he not only Commands his <hi>File,</hi> but makes the firſt onſet againſt his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The <hi>Bringer-up</hi> ought to be the ſecond place in Honour, becauſe he is the laſt Man in the Field march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Reer, which upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of danger he ought to defend.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Half File-Leader</hi> is the third place of Honour, becauſe he is the Leader of the <hi>Reer half Files</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:170789:27"/> upon ſeveral Motions, as doubling the Front, either intire, or diviſional; or upon any other doubling to the Front.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The laſt Man (or <hi>Bringer up</hi>) of the <hi>Front half Files,</hi> is the fourth Man in Dignity; for when the <hi>Reer half Files</hi> are commanded off, he hath the Honour of defending the Reer.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The next Man to the <hi>File-Leader</hi> hath the fifth place of Honour, for one Doubling brings him to the Front.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, The next and laſt place of Honour is before the <hi>Bringer up,</hi> for if the Body be faced about, one Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling brings him into the accidental Front; or keeping his proper Front, by once doubling he becomes <hi>Bringer up</hi> to the <hi>File-Leader.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that it is plain by this <hi>Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Proportion, the whole Body is equivalent in skill and worth, and as it were (and indeed ought to be) Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds the one to the other, ſo long as life endureth.</p>
               <p>And then it may be ſaid of them, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> writeth of the holy Band of the <hi>Thebans,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plutar. in Pelop. A.</note> That it was never beaten
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170789:28"/> until the Battel of <hi>Cheroea;</hi> after which Battel, <hi>Philip</hi> the Father of <hi>Alexander</hi> ſurveying the dead Bodies, and coming to the place where theſe 300 lay, all cloſe mingled one with another, and ſtruck through with the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Pikes, he wonder'd great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but hearing that it was the Band of Lovers, and belov'd, wept, and ſaid, <hi>Evilly may they periſh, that ſuſpect any filthineſs in deed or ſuffering to have been practiſed amongst ſuch Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that you ſee, that in all Ages care hath been taken to beſtow Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour upon thoſe Soldiers who have made it their employ to deſerve it; and on the other hand, what indign Puniſhment hath been inflicted upon all thoſe, who either careleſly, or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully neglect their Duty. I might have inſerted the ſeveral Puniſhments that have been inflicted upon the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient Soldier, but being not mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, I ſhall wave it, and proceed.</p>

               <p>IT is requiſite in the next place that care be taken, that every Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier be rightly inſtructed in all <hi>Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> Signs and Directions; for Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience hath ſufficiently taught, that the neglect and errour in the right underſtanding thereof, hath not only brought great inconveniencies, but the overthrow of great Enterprizes: Therefore the Captain ought to be very circumſpect, that his Soldiers be well acquainted with all the ſigns of War, which are only theſe three uſed, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Vocal,</hi> a <hi>Semivocal,</hi> and a <hi>Mute.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, A <hi>Vocal Sign</hi> is, that when a Captain, or ſome other Officer, ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately Commands, that every Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier ſhall hear him diſtinctly.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Semivocal Sign</hi> is that which is diſtinguiſhed by a <hi>Drum,</hi> or other Warlike Inſtrument, in which, as to Foot-Service, according to modern
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:170789:29"/> Diſcipline, the <hi>Drum</hi> is the only In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument that the Soldier is to take notice of, and ought well to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand theſe ſeveral Beats, or Points of War, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p>Beſides theſe, there are two other Beats of the Drum, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <list>
                     <item>7. A <hi>Tato.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Tato,</hi> (as ſome call it) but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Tapto,</hi> that is, to ſhut or make faſt your Doors, for when this is bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, all perſons ought to repair to their private reſt, whether in Leaguer or Gariſon.</p>
               <p>The Watch being then ſet, and the <hi>Tapto</hi> being returned to the Corps due Guard, there is a Warning-piece diſcharged; after which, no perſon ought to be out of their Quarters, or from their Poſts, without the Word be given them; by which means the Garriſon or Leaguer will be in quiet.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:170789:29"/> So that all private Watches and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinels may more diſtinctly perform their Duty to the ſafety of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon or Leaguer.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Revally</hi> is beaten in the Morning by break of day, (I ſuppoſe it comes from the <hi>French</hi> word <hi>Reveiller,</hi> to awake from Sleep) at which time the Sub-Officers uſually take off their out Sentinels.</p>
               <p>Theſe two laſt ſpoken of (as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) cannot be ſaid to be Points of War, but only private Directions for a Gariſon or Leaguer; the one to give notice at what time the Gariſon or Leaguer ought to be at reſt and quiet, the other to ſhew the hour that the Gates ſhall be ſet open for all Commerce.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Firſt, By a <hi>Call,</hi> you muſt underſtand to hear preſent Proclamation, or elſe to repair to your Enſign.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By a <hi>Troop,</hi> underſtand to ſhoulder your <hi>Musket,</hi> to advance your <hi>Pike,</hi> to cloſe your <hi>Ranks</hi> and <hi>Files</hi> to order, and troop along with
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:170789:30"/> (or follow) your Officer to the place of Randezvouze, or elſewhere.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, By a <hi>March</hi> you are to underſtand, to take your <hi>Open Order</hi> in Rank, to ſhoulder both <hi>Musket</hi> and <hi>Pike,</hi> and to direct your March either quicker or flower, according to the Beat of the <hi>Drum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, By a <hi>Preparative</hi> you are to underſtand, to cloſe to your due diſtance for Skirmiſh both in Rank and File, which diſtance you ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand hereafter, and then to make ready, that ſo you may execute upon the firſt Command.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, By the <hi>Battel</hi> or <hi>Charge</hi> underſtand, the continuation or preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing forward in order of Battel, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out laging behind, rather boldly ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping forward in the place of him that falls dead or wounded before thee.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, By a <hi>Retreat</hi> underſtand, an orderly retiring backward, either for Relief, advantage of the Ground, or for ſome politic end; as to draw the Enemy into ſome Ambuſhment, or ſuch-like: So that for the <hi>Drum,</hi> it is the Voice of the Commander, the Spur of the Valiant, and the Heart of the Coward.

               <p>As for the Antiquity of the <hi>Drum,</hi> is is ſaid, that <hi>Bacchus</hi> was the firſt Inventor of it, and ſo from Age to Age it hath been thought a fit Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Service of the Foot; as you may read at large in theſe ſeveral Authors mentioned in the Margin.<note place="margin">Polyd. lib. 1. in Bac. §. 1.

               <p>The <hi>Captain</hi> (or other Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) being at the Head of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, Commands them to even their Ranks, and ſtreighten their Files, and to ſtand to their <hi>Open Order</hi> both in Rank and File. If your <hi>Enſign</hi> be not already in the Field, Command a <hi>Serjeant</hi> with a Drum, and either two or more Files of Pikes, with two Files of Shot, if neceſſary, that the <hi>Colours</hi> be far off, to guard the <hi>Enſign</hi> to the place of Rendezvouz. This being performed, and every Man in his place,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:170789:42"/> the <hi>Captain</hi> (or other Commander) after ſilence, begins firſt to inſtruct the Soldiers in their ſeveral Diſtances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Rank and File, with the ways to open and cloſe to them; next in the Facings, then in the Doublings; which ſhall be theſe following.</p>
               <p>The Ranks that double are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their Right-hand Man, to move at the ſame time with him. They begin their Motion with the Foot, next the Hand named, which Motion is to be performed at three Steps; in doubling the even Ranks, double the odd. Files doubling is performed in the ſame manner, and is the ſame thing with Reduction of doubled Ranks. The Reduction of doubled Files is the ſame thing with doubling Ranks.</p>
               <p>To double half Files upon a March, let your Reer half Files move into the Front with a quicker Motion, the Front half Files continuing theirs.</p>
               <p>For Reduction, let the Reer half Files ſtand without Facing, 'till the Front half Files have paſſed them, and then fall after their proper Leaders.</p>
